				<h2> English Village Becomes Climate Leader by Quietly Cleaning Up Its Own Patch</h2>
				<hr width=90%>
				<p class='gallery__img'>This small village of about 1,000 people looks like any other nestled in the countryside. But Ashton Hayes is different in an <span class="POS-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> important <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span> <span class="POS-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> way <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span> when it comes to one of the world's most pressing issues: climate change. Hundreds of residents have banded together to cut greenhouse emissions ‚  they use clotheslines instead of dryers, take fewer flights, install solar panels and glaze windows to better insulate their homes. He got the idea a little more than a decade ago after attending a lecture about climate change at the Hay Festival, an annual literary gathering in Wales. He decided to try to get Ashton Hayes to become, as he put it, "Britain's first carbon-neutral village." "But even if we don't," he recalls thinking at the time, "let's try to have a little fun." </br></br>Sometimes, efforts to reduce greenhouse gases involve guilt-tripping or doomsday scenarios that make people feel as if the <span class="NEG-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> problem <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: NEG, Score: Score: -0.95 </span> </span> is too <span class="NEG-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> overwhelming <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: NEG, Score: Score: -0.95 </span> </span> to tackle. In Ashton Hayes ‚ about 25 miles southeast of Liverpool, with a 19th-century Anglican church and a community-owned shop that doubles as a post office ‚  the villagers have lightened the mood. They hold public wine-and-cheese meetings in the biggest houses in town, "so everyone can have a look around," and see how the <span class="NEG-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> wealthier <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: NEG, Score: Score: -0.95 </span> </span> <span class="NEG-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> people <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: NEG, Score: Score: -0.95 </span> </span> live, said Mr. Charnock, the executive director of RSK, an environmental consulting company. "We don't ever finger-wag in Ashton Hayes." About 650 people ‚  more than half of the village's residents ‚  showed up to the first meeting, Mr. Charnock said. </br></br>Some in the village were less keen, but little by little, they began to participate. Some have gone further. When they were looking to build their energy-<span class="POS-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> efficient <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span> <span class="POS-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> home <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span> and heard about Ashton Hayes's carbon-neutral project, Ms. Dossett and her husband, Ian, thought it might be the perfect village for them. They moved from nearby South Warrington and found two old farm cottages, which they converted into a two-story brick house, and installed huge triple-glazed windows, photovoltaic cells on the roof, a geothermal heat pump that heats the home and its water, and an underground cistern to hold rainwater for toilets and the garden. "I wouldn't want anyone to think we live in a mud hut," Ms. Dossett said, sitting on a couch in her <span class="POS-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> warm <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span>, well-lit living <span class="POS-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> room <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span>. The success of the carbon-neutral project seems to have inspired other community efforts in Ashton Hayes. The residents, for example, have built a new playing field with a solar-powered pavilion, which is the home of a community cafe three days a week. They have also put photovoltaic solar panels on the roof of the primary school.</br></br> Though her community's approach is decidedly more political, Ms. Gullvaag said that adopting Ashton Hayes's mantra of fun had paid dividends: She has seen changes in her community, she said, as people buy more electric cars and bicycles, and convert their home heating from oil to more environmentally friendly sources. "Whatever you're trying to do, if you can create enthusiasm and spread knowledge, normally, people will react in a <span class="POS-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> positive <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: POS, Score: 0.95 </span> </span> <span class="POS-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> way <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: POS, Score: 0.95 </span> </span>," she added. Though deep cuts across the globe are still required to make broader progress, actions to reduce emissions, even by small towns, are a step in the right direction, say experts who study community action on climate change. </br></br>"The <span class="POS-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> community <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span>-building element of all this has been as <span class="POS-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> <span class="POS-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> important <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span> <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span> as the environmental <span class="POS-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> impact <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span> so far," said Sarah Darby, a researcher at Oxford University's Environmental Change Institute. She added that Ashton Hayes was in a good position to take on these kinds of projects ‚  it is a small village of well-off and well-educated people, so simply taking fewer flights each year can have a big effect. Residents were able to cut emissions by about 20 percent in the first year alone, according to surveys used to calculate carbon footprints that were developed by Roy Alexander, a local professor, and his students. Some have had even more significant reductions: Households that participated in surveys in both the first and 10th years shrank their energy use by about 40 percent. Mr. Charnock said he thought the village could get the cuts in its 2006 carbon footprint to 80 percent in the next few years with the help of grant money to buy and install solar panels on the local school and other buildings. The next thing they have to do, he said, is to get the county government to be as committed to cutting emissions as Ashton Hayes is. "There's so much apathy," Mr. Charnock said. "We need to squeeze that layer of apathy jelly and get it out."</p>
