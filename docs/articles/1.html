				<h2> What Trump gets wrong on </br>climate change</h2>
				<hr width=90%>
				<p class='gallery__img'>It's become a favorite joke of late-night comics., "You know, sometimes I think Trump is trolling us, people," "Daily Show" host Trevor Noah said last week. "It's like the ultimate troll! Because you realize, every single person he's picked for his cabinet wants to destroy the thing that they've been put in charge of. That last bit seems fair as it applies to climate change. Donald Trump is lining up a number of Cabinet appointees who deny or ignore basic realities of climate science and whose policies could push this country -- already the world's second-<span class="NEG-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> biggest <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: NEG, Score: Score: -0.89 </span> </span> climate <span class="NEG-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> polluter <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: NEG, Score: Score: -0.89 </span> </span> -- back into the dirty fossil fuel era at exactly a time when science seems to mandate the opposite. Perhaps that's no surprise given that the President-elect also is promoting misinformation. , "Nobody really knows' if climate change is real, Trump told Fox News this week. The fact remains: Climate change is real, and humans are causing it. But you'd be more than a little confused if you listened to Trump and the folks he's picked to head the Environmental Protection Agency, State Department and Department of Energy. Here's a <span class="NEG-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> look <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: NEG, Score: -0.7 </span> </span> at their <span class="NEG-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> misguided <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: NEG, Score: -0.7 </span> </span> -- or just plain wrong -- <span class="NEG-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> views <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: NEG, Score: -0.7 </span> </span> on climate science. An EPA head who's suing the EPA, Donald Trump's pick to head the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, does not seem to believe in environmental protection, at least as it applies to climate change. In fact, acting as attorney general of Oklahoma, Pruitt is suing the EPA -- the agency he soon could head -- over Obama's <span class="POS-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> Clean <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span></span> <span class="POS-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> Power Plan <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span>, which aims to reduce pollution deaths, clean up the air and prevent <span class="NEG-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> catastrophic <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: NEG, Score: Score: -0.95 </span> </span> <span class="NEG-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> warming <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: NEG, Score: Score: -0.95 </span> </span>. That plan is now in legal limbo. And Pruitt has described it as "an <span class="NEG-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> unlawful <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: NEG, Score: -0.7 </span> </span> <span class="NEG-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> attempt <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: NEG, Score: -0.7 </span> </span> to expand federal bureaucrats' authority over states' energy economies in order to shutter coal-fired power plants and eventually other sources of fossil-fuel generated electricity," according to the Tulsa World. He's tried to make this a states' rights issue. "When the EPA exceeds the constraints placed upon the agency by Congress, the relationship is thrown out of balance and the rule of law and state sovereignty is affected adversely," Pruitt told a Senate subcommittee last year. There's room for politicians to quibble over which <span class="POS-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> policies <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span> are <span class="POS-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> best <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span> to <span class="POS-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> fight <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span> climate change, of course. But Pruitt also has a record of misrepresenting and ignoring climate science, which clearly shows we humans are warming the planet by burning fossil fuels and clearing rainforests.  "[G]lobal warming has inspired one of the major policy debates of our time," Pruitt said this year in a Tulsa World op-ed, which was co-written by Alabama's attorney general, Luther Strange. "That debate is far from settled. Scientists continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and its connection to the actions of mankind.", Scientists do not truly "disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and its connection to the actions of mankind." On the first point, yes, there are reasonable disagreements about "how bad it will be and how soon its consequences will kick in," as Robinson Meyer put it in The Atlantic. But there's <span class="POS-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> broad <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span> <span class="POS-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> agreement <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span> it will be bad. The science of climate change, meanwhile, has been settled for some time. Depending on which study you cite, between 97% and 99.9% of actively publishing climate scientists -- or their studies -- agree the climate is warming and humans are largely responsible. Debate the <span class="POS-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> best <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span> <span class="POS-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> policies <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span> to get us off of fossil fuels and onto <span class="POS-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> cleaner <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span> <span class="POS-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> energy <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span>, sure. But there is no debate on the science. Efforts to inject one are both <span class="NEG-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> misleading <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: NEG, Score: Score: -0.95 </span> </span> and dangerous. A Secretary of State from ExxonMobil, Trump's secretary of state pick, Rex Tillerson, is closer to the truth on his stated understanding of climate science. But it's unclear whether he'd actually do anything about it. This matters because Tillerson -- currently the CEO of ExxonMobil, one of the world's <span class="NEG-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> biggest <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: NEG, Score: Score: -0.89 </span> </span> fossil fuel <span class="NEG-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> companies <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: NEG, Score: Score: -0.89 </span> </span> -- would represent the US in international climate change negotiations. John Kerry, Obama's outgoing secretary of state, negotiated the Paris Agreement, a landmark treaty aimed at limiting warming to 2 degrees Celsius. He forged new ties with China, now the <span class="NEG-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> biggest <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: NEG, Score: Score: -0.89 </span> </span> annual climate <span class="NEG-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> polluter <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: NEG, Score: Score: -0.89 </span> </span>, to help make that happen. The treaty basically sets the goal of ridding the world economy of fossil fuels this century, hopefully closer to 2050 than 2100. Now the CEO of a fossil fuel company could take Kerry's place in those negotiations. Tillerson, thankfully, does acknowledge humans are causing climate change., "I'm not disputing that increasing CO2 emissions in the atmosphere is going to have an impact. It will have a warming impact," he said at a Council of Foreign Relations event in 2012. In November, ExxonMobil also expressed belated support for the Paris climate accord. But ExxonMobil knew about the dangers of climate change in the 1970s and hid that information from investors and the public, according to an eight-month investigation by InsideClimate News, a Pulitzer prize-winning news organization. (ExxonMobil says on its website that it "completely rejects the allegations made in these reports"). And Tillerson hedges on the consequences of the warming he acknowledges fossil fuels are helping to cause. "[O]ur ability to predict, with any accuracy, what the future's going to be is really pretty limited," he said. While there are uncertainties about exactly how <span class="NEG-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> <span class="NEG-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> catastrophic <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: NEG, Score: Score: -0.95 </span> </span> <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: NEG, Score: Score: -0.95 </span> </span> unchecked climate <span class="NEG-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> change <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: NEG, Score: Score: -0.95 </span> </span> will be -- and when, exactly, certain tipping points, such as the melting of Greenland, which could raise sea levels 7 meters, will be crossed -- the crisis we face is clear.(cont)</p>
