				<h2> Tesla's Model 3 orders are through the roof. Here's what that means for the planet.</h2>
				<hr width=90%>
				<p class='gallery__img'>It's being hailed as simply extraordinary. Since introducing the Model 3 sedan -- a far cheaper electric vehicle, aimed for broader consumption, than the Model S -- Tesla saw a  <span class="POS-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> stunning <span class="tooltiptext"> type: OPINION, polarity: POS, Score: 0.95</span></span> 276,000  <span class="POS-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> orders <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: POS, Score: 0.95 </span> </span> in just two days. Tesla aims to sell 500,000 electric vehicles per year by 2020 -- an  <span class="POS-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> ambitious <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span>  <span class="POS-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> goal <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span> but one that, based on these numbers, doesn't sound so unachievable. (That number presumably includes sales of all Tesla models, not just the new Model 3. Deliveries in 2015 were around 50,000 of all Tesla vehicles, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.) [The car industry has never witnessed what Tesla is about to go through]   </br></br>Clearly, part of the appeal of the new vehicle is not just its sleekness or new range, but rather, its environmental promise and symbolism. One key question, though, is what this surge in Tesla sales means for a critical parameter that will determine the planet's future: By electrifying transportation (and thus, powering cars not with gasoline derived from oil, but rather, with an electricity supply that itself is getting greener), how fast can we start to bring down the United States', and the planet's, emissions? Several experts this week said that booming Tesla sales don't make enough of a dent in transportation -- at least not immediately -- to shift this in a  <span class="POS-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> substantial <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span>  <span class="POS-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> way <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span>.The problem is that the global auto industry is massive, and even a half-million Tesla sales per year isn't all that much in that context. "Even if Tesla manages to scale up and hit its  <span class="NEG-INTENSIFIER" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> very <span class="tooltiptext">type: INTENSIFIER, polarity: NEG, Score: 1.0 </span> </span>  <span class="NEG-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> aggressive <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: NEG, Score: Score: -1.23 </span> </span>  <span class="NEG-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> target <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: NEG, Score: Score: -1.23 </span> </span> of 500,000 vehicles a year by 2020, that would still represent only about .5 percent of global light-duty vehicle sales," said Colin McKerracher, head of  <span class="POS-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> advanced <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span>  <span class="POS-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> transport <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span> at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. "So it's hard to have an overall impact from them alone." However, if what we're seeing marks a broader shift, in which Tesla ends up driving the rest of the auto industry to change and make more electric cars, that's another matter. </br></br>"It's obviously important for Tesla, but I think it's going to push other automakers to match what Tesla's doing, and also get other people to think about switching to electric," said David Reichmuth, a senior engineer in the  <span class="POS-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> clean <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span> vehicles  <span class="POS-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> program <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span> at the Union of Concerned Scientists. </br></br> Margo Oge, former director of the EPA's Office of Transportation and Air Quality and author of the book "Driving the Future: Combating Climate Change with  <span class="POS-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up">  <span class="POS-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> Cleaner <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span> <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span>, Smarter Cars," concurred. "What it's doing is bringing the cost down on the battery, making it affordable, putting pressure on other companies," said Oge of Tesla's success. These are  <span class="POS-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> important <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span>  <span class="POS-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> impacts <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span>, even if there still may not be enough electric vehicles on the road to cut down emissions a lot -- at least not immediately.  </br></br>  To see why it's so  <span class="NEG-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> hard <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: NEG, Score: 0.98 </span> </span> to quickly  <span class="POS-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> move <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: POS, Score: 0.98 </span> </span> the needle in this arena, just consider some numbers. Currently, light-duty vehicles sold around the world annually number (get ready to gasp) 88.5 million in 2015, according to Navigant Research. And they're expected to grow, and grow, and grow. Out of that annual total, according to the U.S. Department of Energy, there were some 565,000 sales of plug-in light electric vehicles in 2015. So you see the small percentages that we're dealing with (even though sales are also rising quite rapidly).</br></br>Current forecasts expect electric vehicles to become more  <span class="POS-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> prominent <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span> in the  <span class="POS-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> mix <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span>, but few expect any sort of really  <span class="NEG-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> rapid <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: NEG, Score: Score: -0.94 </span> </span>  <span class="NEG-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> transition <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: NEG, Score: Score: -0.94 </span> </span>. Bloomberg New Energy Finance, for instance, thinks electric vehicles sales will be less than 5 percent of total vehicle sales globally until about 2022, when battery technology becomes cheap enough to really, really compete. This means that it's around 2040 that the numbers really get impressive â€š  in that year, 35 percent of new cars sold could be EVs, the group thinks, and they could comprise about 25 percent of the global auto fleet. "By and large, EVs still compare favorably in all but the most dirty grids. But the grid gets cleaner over time," said McKerracher. Thus, the growth of  <span class="POS-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> clean <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span>  <span class="POS-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> electricity <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span> and the reduction of vehicle emissions turn out to be closely linked.
The  <span class="POS-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> prices <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span> are also potentially more  <span class="POS-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> stable <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span>.
