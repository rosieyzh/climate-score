				<h2> World leaders close ranks on climate change: 'Paris agreement cannot be renegotiated'</h2>
				<hr width=90%>
				<p class='gallery__img'>World leaders closed ranks Thursday, vowing to press on with the fight against global warming, even as President Trump said he was pulling the United States out of a landmark climate agreement.', 'In a swift rebuke of Trump's decision, the leaders of France, Germany and Italy said the accord reached in 2015 after years of fraught negotiations was a "vital instrument for our planet" and they "firmly believe" it cannot be renegotiated, as the U.S. is now demanding.', '"We are convinced that the implementation of the Paris agreement offers <span class="POS-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> substantial <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span> economic <span class="POS-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> opportunities <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span> for prosperity and growth in our countries and on a global scale," French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni said in a statement.
Therefore we reaffirm our <span class="POS-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> strongest <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span> <span class="POS-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> commitment <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span> to swiftly implement the Paris agreement."</br></br>Even before Trump announced his decision, <span class="POS-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> nations <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span> <span class="POS-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> rich <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span> and poor had reiterated their commitment to the global climate change accord, in which they pledged to work together to reduce emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases and transition their economies to <span class="POS-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> cleaner <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span> energy <span class="POS-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> sources <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span>. A number of U.S. governors and mayors, as well as a slew of corporate leaders, joined in a chorus of disapproval for Trump's move, declaring that the effects of climate change are already being felt, and that there are economic opportunities in embracing new energy technologies. </br></br>Former President Obama, who regards the global pact as a signature achievement of his administration, said those countries that chose to remain in the treaty would "reap the benefits in jobs and industries created." Republican lawmakers, however, mostly applauded the decision, describing Obama's environmental policies as an assault on domestic energy production and jobs. Members of the Group of 7 highly industrialized nations "tried to explain this in clear, simple sentences to Mr. Trump" at a recent summit in Italy, but "it looks like that attempt failed. Not everything which is law, and not everything which is written in international treaties, is fake news." "Today the president announced that the United States will no longer be bound by an agreement unilaterally entered into by the Obama administration. This was neither submitted to nor ratified by the U.S. Senate, and is not in the <span class="POS-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> best <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span> long term economic <span class="POS-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> interest <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span> of the United States.', '"Instead of preaching about <span class="POS-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> clean <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span> <span class="POS-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> energy <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span>, this administration will act on it. Our <span class="POS-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> work <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span> and deeds are more <span class="POS-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> <span class="POS-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> important <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span> <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span> than empty <span class="POS-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> words <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span>. I know you can drive economic growth and protect the environment at the same time, because that is exactly what I did as governor of Texas." "Simply put, the private sector already chose a low-carbon future. And for the nations that committed themselves to that future, the Paris Agreement opened the floodgates for businesses, scientists, and engineers to unleash high-tech, low-carbon investment and innovation on an unprecedented scale. "The nations that remain in the Paris Agreement will be the nations that reap the benefits in jobs and industries created. I believe the United States of America should be at the front of the pack. But even in the absence of American leadership even as this administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future I'm confident that our states, cities and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we've got." "I applaud President Trump and his administration for dealing yet another significant blow to the Obama administration's assault on domestic energy production and jobs. "President Obama made commitments in this deal based off a costly power plan that we knew at the time was on shaky legal ground. By withdrawing from this unattainable mandate, President Trump has reiterated his commitment to protecting middle class families across the country and workers throughout coal country from higher energy prices and potential job loss." "Here we are, in 2017, going backwards," Brown said in an interview with the Los Angeles Times. "It cannot stand it's not right, and California will do everything it can to not only stay the course, but to build more support ‚ in other states, in other provinces, in other countries." "Climate change is a fact of life that people in Los Angeles and cities around the world live with every day. It is a grave threat to our health, our environment, and our economy ‚ and it is not debatable or negotiable. "With the President pulling out of the Paris Climate Agreement, L.A. will lead by committing to the goals of the accord ‚ and will work closely with cities across America and the world to do the same.</p>
