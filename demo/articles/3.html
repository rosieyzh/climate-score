				<h2> India seeks to balance development with need for </br>clean energy</h2>
				<hr width=90%>

Typically, kerosene lanterns, synonymous with darkened lungs and ominous clouds of air pollution, provide light for the country's 300 million residents who live without any <span class="POS-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> reliable <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span> <span class="POS-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> access <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span> to power.

"Climate change is not of our making," Modi said in his Monday address at the conference. "It is the result of global warming that came from the prosperity and progress of an industrial age powered by fossil fuel. But we in India face its consequences today. We see it in the risks of our farmers, the changes in weather patterns, and the intensity of natural disasters." Government corruption at the state level, as well as other weakened areas of infrastructure such as railways, roads and bridges, presents <span class="NEG-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> substantial <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: NEG, Score: Score: -0.99 </span> </span> <span class="NEG-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> obstacles <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: NEG, Score: Score: -0.99 </span> </span> in providing energy to those who need it, even without the additional cost of switching to solar or wind power. "To move the country off of coal and onto solar will require <span class="POS-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> considerable <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: POS, Score: 0.88 </span> </span> foreign <span class="POS-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> investment <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: POS, Score: 0.88 </span> </span>," Palit said in a phone interview. "It will be hard to achieve these goals alone." </br></br>Michael Grubb, professor of international energy and climate change policy at University College London and an advisor to Britain at the Paris conference, said a <span class="POS-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> hard <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: POS, Score: 0.98 </span> </span> <span class="POS-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> cap <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: POS, Score: 0.98 </span> </span> on India's carbon emissions, as requested by Western countries, is essentially "out of the question" based on Modi's rhetoric and the developmental needs of the country. "India wants an acknowledgment of the different roles each country plays in climate change, because while they make up nearly a fifth of the world's population, they release significantly lower amounts of carbon emissions per person compared to China and America, even if that number is likely to increase going forward," Grubb said in a phone interview. "They are highly dependent on <span class="POS-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> stable <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span> food <span class="POS-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> production <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: POS, Score: 0.99 </span> </span> and on water runoff from Himalayas, so you can certainly paint the picture that climate change is a <span class="NEG-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> serious <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: NEG, Score: Score: -0.81 </span> </span> <span class="NEG-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> threat <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: NEG, Score: Score: -0.81 </span> </span> to the Indian way of life. But then at the same time they make the point that they are not the creators of this problem, so we have a deadlock." Grubb said India may require not just foreign investment, but also a significant pledge of financial assistance to reach an agreement in Paris. </br></br>Modi struck an emotional note Monday when he called for "climate justice," referring to the need for other countries to acknowledge the uniquely compromised position in which India and other developing nations find themselves in these negotiations.', '"India will accelerate the renewable <span class="NEG-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> energy <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: NEG, Score: Score: -0.98 </span> </span> only if they receive assistance from developed countries, because right now renewable energy is far more <span class="NEG-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> expensive <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: NEG, Score: Score: -0.98 </span> </span> for them than using coal," Grubb said. </br></br>"It's understandable that they want to get their population away from lanterns and biomass cooking." The requirements from the Western side for a deal are considerably more vague, given the <span class="NEG-OPINION" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> high <span class="tooltiptext">type: OPINION, polarity: NEG, Score: Score: -0.98 </span> </span> <span class="NEG-ASPECT" aria-label="" data-balloon-pos="up"> stakes <span class="tooltiptext">type: ASPECT, polarity: NEG, Score: Score: -0.98 </span> </span> created by climate change, and the general understanding that India will not agree to put a cap on its projected carbon emissions before 2030.', '"America and Europe want a sign from India that they are willing to take action against the country\'s rising levels of carbon emissions," said Joanna Lewis, an assistant professor at Georgetown University who specializes in climate change.
